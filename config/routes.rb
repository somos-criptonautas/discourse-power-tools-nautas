# frozen_string_literal: true

# Routes for the Jtech bundle. Each sub-plugin's URLs are appended directly
# under Discourse::Application — we don't mount the sub-plugins' Rails
# engines.
#
# Why: mounting `DiscourseModCategories::Engine` reliably raised
#   ArgumentError: Invalid route name, already in use: 'discourse_mod_categories'
# at boot, no matter what `as:` we passed or whether the mount was inside
# `routes.draw` or `routes.append`. Something earlier in the boot pipeline
# (Discourse's plugin loader, presumably, since this engine module is also
# referenced from sub_plugins/mod_categories.rb's PluginStore namespace and
# locale tree) registers the helper name first, so a second mount collides.
# Bypassing the engine mount avoids the collision and the route table is
# functionally identical — the controllers under
# `app/controllers/<namespace>/` are autoloaded by Rails regardless of
# whether their parent module is mounted as an engine.
#
# Sub-plugins that don't register routes — Dislike, Another SMTP, Mini-mod —
# rely on Discourse's existing routes via Guardian overrides and event hooks,
# so they have no entries here.
