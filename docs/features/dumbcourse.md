# Dumbcourse: the forum for flip phones

A light version of the forum at `/dumb` for flip phones, KaiOS and old Android browsers that can't run the full site. It works with the D-pad and keypad like the phone's own apps, and on touch screens and computers too.

- **Reading.** Latest, New, Unread, Top, Hot, categories and tags:
  - **↑↓** reads; a long post scrolls before focus moves on.
  - **←→** switches tabs.
  - Unread topics open at your first unread post, and Back returns you exactly where you were.
  - Live updates and read tracking.
- **Doing.** **OK** on a post opens its actions: like or react, reply, quote, bookmark, edit, delete, flag, copy link, every link in the post, hidden text (spoilers and details), and the post's pictures. There's a full-screen composer with mentions, emoji, formatting, uploads, preview and optional spell check.
- **Pictures.** **View picture** opens it full screen; with several, a gallery of thumbnails comes first. **OK** zooms (fit, 2×, 3×), the D-pad moves a zoomed picture around or, at fit, goes to the previous / next picture, `4` / `6` go to the previous / next picture at any zoom, and the right soft key saves a forum upload to the phone.
- **Your stuff.** Notifications, bookmarks, drafts, messages, profile, search and REQ-PM, with one-press **Call / Text / WhatsApp**.
- **Signing in without typing a password on a keypad.** Approve the phone from another signed-in device, or use an emailed link or code, social logins, or password plus two-factor code. Sign-up, password reset and account activation work here too.
- **Keys.**
  - Anywhere: `*` menu, `#` search, `0` help, `1`/`7` top and bottom, `2`/`8` page up and down, `4` back.
  - In a topic: `3` reply, `5` like, `9` jump to post.
  - Soft keys that a phone names oddly can be taught under Preferences → Phone keys.
  - In the Android app on a keypad phone, the app draws the soft-key bar and handles the soft keys itself. Preferences → Phone keys → Detect soft keys finds keys it doesn't know.
- **Looks.** Light, dark or automatic; text size; compact layout; avatars on or off; data saver. All chosen per phone.
- **Old phones find it by themselves.** Browsers that can't run the full forum are sent to the matching Dumbcourse page, including links in emails. Search engines never are (`dumbcourse_redirect_legacy_browsers`).
- **Safe by construction.**
  - Strict Content-Security-Policy and no framing.
  - Everything escaped by default.
  - Private data kept per account and wiped on logout.
  - Rate limits.
