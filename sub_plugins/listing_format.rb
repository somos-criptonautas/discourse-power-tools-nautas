# frozen_string_literal: true
# Jtech sub-plugin: Listing format — sale threads where every post is a
# listing, and buyers reach the seller through REQ-PM instead of replying.
#
# In the topics listed in listing_format_topics, a new post must have each
# section from listing_format_fields ("### ITEM" with the item under it),
# and may not link to other sites: only email addresses, phone numbers and
# the forum itself. A post that breaks either rule is turned away with the
# reason, before it's saved, so nothing is hidden or deleted afterwards.
# That also turns away comments ("still available?"): each listing has the
# seller's REQ-PM button instead, and its Reply button is gone.
#
# Posts written before a topic was listed are left alone. Editing one is
# checked against what it already had: an edit can't add an outside link
# or take out a field the post had, but it doesn't have to add the rest.
